## About the Video Course
GraphQL is an API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. One of the most common problems with REST is over and under fetching of data. GraphQL gives you the flexibility to think of the APIs as a graph and not as endpoints. Hence the execution becomes easier and quicker.

In this course, you will start with getting ready to install and explore GraphQL for a better RESTful experience. You will explore the architecture and use cases to better understand the package setup and architecture involved. You'll learn more about the GraphQL server by coding its routes and constructing its schema. All the demonstrations in this video course will be shown through the development of a typical real-world restaurant rating application to better understand of users.

You will learn how to deal with validation, error handling, and security. Finally, you will learn and know more about caching & batching requests, pagination in GraphQL and so on.
